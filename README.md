Got a web crawler? Mine's better. Why? It was generated by you know who...

Here's the idea:
- You get connected to free wifi ... secure yourself to the max... yada yada ...
- You get a collection of links... probably worse than just using google yourself.

In development:

- Having all the necessary browsers and dependencies installed ... or just downloading a base / partial / full package ...
- The program aggreggates the links in the specific order of browsers you choose ...
- You click link and it opens up the corresponding browser and takes you to site ...

All somewhat private and secure browsers will be in the full package, but you may just want to download only the program and choose your own browser options ... in which case you pick Partial
If you don't want any nonsense "user-friendliness", just download base, plus it also uses less RAM if you are a potato-computer-owner.
